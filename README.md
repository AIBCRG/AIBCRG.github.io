# Artificial Intelligence, Biomechatronics, and Collaborative Robotics

## Biomechatronics

Biomechatronics is a multidisciplinary field that combines principles of biology and mechatronics (electrical, electronics, and mechanical engineering). It also encompasses the fields of robotics and neuroscience. This discipline aims at designing and controlling advanced robotic systems that interact with the human body. This field includes a wide range of applications, including the design and control of wearable and implantable devices, prosthetics, exoskeletons, and assistive robots.

## Collaborative Robotics

Collaborative Robotics is a branch of Biomechatronics that explores the interaction and collaboration between humans and robots. This includes the design of robotic systems that can work alongside humans in shared environments, as well as the study of human-robot interaction and the development of new control strategies to enable effective collaboration. 

The evolution of the field may be seen as a gradual approach to human-robot interaction, human-robot cooperation, and human-robot teaming:

- **Human-robot interaction** is the study of how humans and robots interact, as well as how to develop robots that can adapt to human behavior.
- **Human-robot cooperation** expands on this by creating new approaches and technologies that allow robots to collaborate with people in shared environments.
- **Human-robot teaming** goes one step further, by studying how to create teams of humans and robots that can work together effectively and efficiently to achieve common goals.
